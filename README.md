# ICS generator
* Do you also struggle with recurring events in your calendar?
* Is your calendar app messing them up?
* Are they shown incomplete or random events missing?
* Is everything weird, after you edit one event?

That is the reason, I use individual calendar events even for recurring appointments. And to generate a long sequence of very similar (identical except the date) events this tool was born.

You can generate .ICS calendar files containing your recurring event. These files can easily be imported to your calendar.

## Usage
ICS generator is split in two input sections:

### Event Description (left pane)
Here you enter all information regarding a single event itself. It is more or less the same you would enter in your day-to-day calendar app. Some fields are optional and can be enabled with checkboxes. If disabled they are not exported to the final calendar file.

### Recurrence (right pane)
Here you define the dates your event shall take place. You can configure some basic recurrence pattern like weekly or monthly. After pressing GENERATE the list is filled matching the recurrence pattern and the selected year. You can select and delete arbitrary entries from that list to get only the dates you like.

### Export
If everything is configured to your needs, just export to an .ICS file by pressing SAVE.

## License
Up to now I have not thought about a proper license model. But in general you are allowed to do everything you like with the code and the executable when you doing it for your private usage.
* You are not allowed to use it in any relation with commercial (money-earning) stuff.
* You are not allowed to redistribute the code, or claim it to be yours.
* I give absolutely NO guaranty for function of the app or even damage to your equipment.
